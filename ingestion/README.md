# Ingestion Layer (Reserved for Future Use)

This folder is reserved for **future data ingestion scripts**, especially for live or external APIs.

### ðŸ§° Planned Use Cases:
- Python scripts for pulling data from public APIs (e.g., NFL, weather, etc.)
- Integrations with tools like Airbyte or Fivetran
- Local extraction and formatting scripts for batch ingestion

### ðŸ“Œ Current Status
This repo primarily uses dbt seed files to load synthetic sales data. There are no active ingestion pipelines in use, but this folder provides space for future expansion.

### ðŸ”§ Example:
```bash
python nfl_data_fetch.py
